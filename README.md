Hello.
I'm Ralf from Germany, so please excuse my english is not perfekt ;o).

I joined GitHub, because at the moment I have some problems with Marlin firmware resulting incorrect prints of my 3D printer.

Here are some infos about me current 3D printer hardware:
- Completely new DIY designed frame with ITEM construction aluminium profiles and IGUS slide bearing technology.
- Only the stepper motors, the power supply, the heat bed, the extruder and some cables I currently use from the former ANET printer.
- 3D-Printer-Controller-Kit: RAMPS1.4 + MEGA 2560 R3 + A4988 driver for X Y Z and extruder --> imported from China SO NOT original Arduino.
- Slicing with Prusa-Slicer and CURA, printing via RepetierHost and USB, especialy at the moment for test printing.
  Later if all things are working propperly I will print mainly over SD-Card.
